# Desafio-TETRIS
This challenge was proposed by the programming laboratory discipline, in which we used various basic knowledge such as pointers, string manipulation and conventional data structures.

The purpose of the challenge is to register a piece that has a type, color, edge (or not), weight and size.

The structure I used to store the pieces was a doubly linked list that makes it easier to reorganize.

Finally, I used the insertion sort algorithm to do the reorganization.
